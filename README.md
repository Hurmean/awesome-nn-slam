# Awesome-NN-SLAM

**:running::running::running:Under initial construction.**

**If you find something wrong or want to add something new, don't hesitate to make an issue or a PR.**

This repo is used to record neural network algorithms, either about a complete SLAM system, or part of it. 

For each paper, we should answer the following questions:
- What **problems** does it solve?
- What **methods** does it propose?
- How are the **results**?
- What **challenges** or **deficiencies** does it face?
- **Where** is it published? **Who** are the authors?

In addition, some related resources, such as hyperlinks to open-source codes and PDF files, are also welcome.
